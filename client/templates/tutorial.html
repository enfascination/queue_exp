            <b>Welcome.</b> After reviewing these instructions you will take a comprehension quiz. You must pass it in order to participate in the main experiment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>If you fail the quiz</b> you will earn only the <span class="earnings">{{earnings design.earnings.HIT}}</span> reward and no bonuses, and you will not be able to repeat the HIT.

            <b>The theoretical maximum bonus</b> from this experiment is <span class="earnings">{{earnings design.earnings.maxBonus}}</span>. The minimum possible bonus from the core experiment is <span class="earnings">{{earnings 0}}</span>, not including a guaranteed <span class="earnings">{{earnings design.earnings.quiz}}</span> in bonuses for passing the quiz, and <span class="earnings">{{earnings design.earnings.survey}}</span> for completing the short survey.
