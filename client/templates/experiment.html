    You are being endowed with a {{endowment}} account.   You will earn additional money for joining the line based on your final position in it. Specifically, you will earn an additional {{pot}} minus {{positionCosts}} for each person ahead of your position in the line.  
    </p> 
    <p> 
    The line consists of two groups, A and B.  Joining group B puts you behind everyone who joined B before you and behind everyone who will chose to join group A.  Joining group A puts you ahead of everyone in group B, and behind those who have joined group A before you.  However, joining group A will cost 50 cents from your {{endowment}} account, while joining group B costs nothing. Below you can see the current membership in each group.
    </p>
    <p>
    Based on your position in this experiment, joining group A will result in a minimum of {{earningsAMin}} and a maximum of {{earningsAMax}}, while joining group B will result in a minimum of {{earningsBMin}} and a maximum of {{earningsBMax}}.
