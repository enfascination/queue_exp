            <p>In the following simple games, you will be matched randomly with other Turkers.  You will have a choice between two options, as will the other player.  You will get paid for your choice, but the amounts you each earn will depend not just on your choice, but on other player's choice.  Below you will have a choice between Top and Bottom.</p>

    You are being endowed with a {{endowment}} account.   You will earn additional money for joining the line based on your final position in it. Specifically, you will earn an additional {{pot}} minus {{positionCosts}} for each person ahead of your position in the line.  
    </p> 
    <p> 
    The line consists of two groups, A and B.  Joining group B puts you behind everyone who joined B before you and behind everyone who will chose to join group A.  Joining group A puts you ahead of everyone in group B, and behind those who have joined group A before you.  However, joining group A will cost 50 cents from your {{endowment}} account, while joining group B costs nothing. Below you can see the current membership in each group.
    </p>
    <p>
    Based on your position in this experiment, joining group A will result in a minimum of {{earningsAMin}} and a maximum of {{earningsAMax}}, while joining group B will result in a minimum of {{earningsBMin}} and a maximum of {{earningsBMax}}.
