###
  Add a hook to Meteor's login system:
  To account for for MTurk use, except for admin users
  for users who are not currently assigned to a HIT.
###

  return true if info.user?.admin # Always allow admin to login

  # If resuming, is the worker currently assigned to a HIT?
  # TODO add a test for this
  if info.methodArguments[0].resume?

      workerId: info.user.workerId
      status: "assigned"
    )
      throw new Meteor.Error(403, "Your HIT session has expired.")

  # TODO Does the worker have this open in another window? If so, reject the login.
  # This is a bit fail-prone due to leaking sessions across HCR, so take it out.
#  if info.user? and UserStatus.connections.findOne(userId: info.user._id)
#    throw new Meteor.Error(403, "You already have this open in another window. Complete it there.")

  Authenticate a worker taking an assignment.
  Returns an assignment object corresponding to the assignment.
